# IBM Operational Decision Manager for Developers - Rule Designer

## Features
Rule Designer is the Eclipse-based development environment for ODM developers. Rule Designer is needed to begin the development of a decision service. You must define a XOM and set up a vocabulary so that you can author and orchestrate business rules.

In the designer, developers can edit and debug Java code and rules alongside each other. The key features include auto correction of rules, decision flow control, code-generation wizards, source code control integration, and conflict and redundancy detection. Used with Decision Center and Rule Execution Server, Rule Designer completes a collaborative work environment for developers, business users, integrators, and release managers to automate a company's business policies.

## What to do next
If you want to establish a secure TLS connection or/and use an OpenID provider with ODM on Kubernetes, you need to import a certificate into the cacerts file and configure the OpenID provider in the JVM used to launch Rule Designer. 
Steps to configure Rule Designer are explains :
- In the [Cloud Pak for Business Automation 24.0.0 ](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/24.0.0?topic=manager-importing-security-certificate-in-rule-designer) documentation
- In the [Operational Decision Manager for Kubernetes 9.0.0](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/odm/9.0.0?topic=designer-importing-security-certificate-in-rule) documentation
